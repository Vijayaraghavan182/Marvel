            <h4>Stan Lee was more than a comic book writer he was a storyteller, a dreamer, and a cultural icon who
                redefined what it means to be a hero. Born in 1922, Stan Lee co-created some of the most iconic and
                beloved characters in history: Spider-Man, Iron Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Thor, Black Panther,
                and countless more. But what made his creations truly special wasn’t just their powers it was their
                humanity. Stan gave us heroes who struggled with self-doubt, made mistakes, felt pain, and yet still
                chose to do good. He made them real, relatable, and inspirational.

                Through Marvel Comics, he built a vast universe where heroes of every kind could shine. He broke
                boundaries, championed diversity, and used his stories to reflect the world around us. His characters
                taught generations about responsibility, sacrifice, love, and resilience.

                Stan Lee wasn’t just the creator of a universe he became part of our universe. His cameos in Marvel
                films were moments fans cherished, not just for nostalgia, but as tributes to the man behind the magic.
                He was the heart of Marvel and the voice of every fan who ever dreamed bigger because of him.

                Even after his passing in 2018, Stan Lee’s legacy lives on in every comic panel, every film frame, and
                every fan’s heart. We are proud to have known his work and grateful for his imagination. As he often
                said, “Excelsior!” ever upward. Thank you, Stan, for showing us the hero in all of us.</h4>
